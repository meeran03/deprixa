# Why Deprixa
A virtual address system for courier management and tracking inspired by deprixa in PHP

<p>I had a business idea of creating a virtual address in different countries to solve the problems we face while buying things for ecommerce stores like amazon and ebay. I decided to find a solution and deprixa was the closest thing I found near that model. Yet it was a long way to go. So, I set out to create my first custom Project in pure php. I learned alot along the way like stripe payment gateway integration, how core php works. How powerful php is. To be honest, :smile:, it was this time when I realised the power of Laravel and then said goodbye to PHP for good</p>
